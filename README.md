### unmixR
#### An R package for unmixing of hyperspectral images

hyperspectral data are also called 'imaging spectroscopy' and 'imaging spectrometer data' depending upon the discipline.  Such data consists of spectra collected over an x, y grid.  Data sets like this are found in airborne land imaging studies, biomedical studies and art history investigations.  The spectra are often visible, infrared, near-infrared, raman spectra or mass spectrometer data sets.

Support for the initial development of `unmixR` was provided by [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013).

Active development of `unmixR` is now hosted on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/chemometrics/unmixR).  Please visit for the latest developments.
